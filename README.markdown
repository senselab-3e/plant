# Rotating 3D plant (css)
  
Refactored original sprawlingy css/html code from original code-pen, into reusable createthingy() function to construct rotating 3d thingy, from any array (of pathways to image files). The contents that can be used to make up any array, can be derived from the img folder. 
 
 original Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/kunukn/pen/ZJdpXx](https://codepen.io/kunukn/pen/ZJdpXx).

Firefox has 3D order issues I think and IE11 can't do 3D.
